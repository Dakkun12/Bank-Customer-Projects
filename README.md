Bank Customer Churn Analysis Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn within a bank's customer base. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company or service. By understanding the factors contributing to churn, the bank can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve overall satisfaction.

Project Components
Data Collection: Data was collected from the bank's customer database, including various attributes such as customer ID, account number, credit score, age, tenure, churn status, and more.
Data Analysis: SQL queries were used to analyze the data and identify patterns related to customer churn. Analysis included examining churn rates across different demographics, such as age, gender, credit score, and tenure.
Data Visualization: Tableau was used to create visualizations based on the analyzed data. Visualizations include bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines to provide insights into churn patterns and trends.
Insights and Recommendations: Based on the analysis and visualizations, insights were drawn regarding factors influencing churn. Recommendations were made to the bank on strategies to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
Key Findings
Churn rates vary across different demographic segments, with certain groups exhibiting higher churn than others.
Factors such as age, gender, credit score, and tenure have a significant impact on churn likelihood.
Customers with lower credit scores tend to have higher churn rates, indicating a potential correlation between financial stability and customer loyalty.
Recommendations
Implement targeted marketing campaigns to retain customers with low credit scores by offering personalized financial solutions and incentives.
Improve customer service and communication channels to address issues and concerns promptly, thereby enhancing overall customer experience and satisfaction.
Enhance product offerings and features to cater to the evolving needs and preferences of different customer segments, thereby increasing customer retention.
Conclusion
Customer churn is a critical metric for banks, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, this project provides valuable insights into churn patterns and offers actionable recommendations for reducing churn and improving customer retention.
